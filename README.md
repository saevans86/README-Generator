# Title 
Readme-Generator




## Description 
The project is used to populate a READMEME.md file based upon user selection using nodejs as well as inquirer. 

My motivation for this project was to try and learn node.js as well as possible, and to create this readme generator specific to my needs.

I built this project to make creating a readme easier than having to format a readme through github, although some of the features feel redundant, their use outweights any redundancy in my opinion.

This readme generator will make creating a quality readme fast reliably, and all that would be needed is to add screenshots etc after. (I would like to see if there's a way it can be done through the terminal.) I also think having additional licenses available to select would be beneficial to the project. 

Going into this new project with node was very different from what I'm used to in terms of being able to look dev tools in chrome and seeing an instant error. I'm still trying to learn some of the errors. One of the first issues I encountered was not remembering to be in the same folder as my node index.js file when trying to run it, so now I am more careful to make sure I'm running from the correct place. I'm really enjoying the module imports/exports ideas and through my research found that it's possible to import variables as well, which to me is pretty rad.

## Features 
The project features are currently only using 3 different types of licenses which I searched to find are the most used/most popular licenses.







## Tests 
No tests have currently been performed, however I will be running through this multiple times to make sure that each of the badges/links/license descriptions display name/date correcty. (Confirmed working correctly for each license)
